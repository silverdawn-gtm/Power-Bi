Financial Sales Report
Overview
The goal was to create different types of charts and visuals to understand how sales are doing, what products are performing well, and which countries and segments are profitable.
Data Used
The data includes information like:
Product names
Countries where sales happened
Market segments (like Government, Midmarket, etc.)
Sales amounts
Profit values
Dates of transactions
Visuals I Made
Here are the charts and visuals I created in the report:
Line Chart – Shows how sales have changed over time.
Bar Chart – Compares sales between different countries.
Pie Chart – Shows the percentage of sales for each product.
Stacked Bar Chart – Breaks down sales by business segments.
Matrix – Combines country, product, sales, and profit data all in one place.
Scatter Plot – Compares profit against sales for different products and countries.
Map – Shows where the sales are coming from, on a global map.
Waterfall Chart – Breaks down profit changes by different factors.
Treemap – A cool visual that shows the sales for each product in a tree-like format.
Donut Chart – Similar to the pie chart but fancier, showing sales distribution by market segment.
Card – A big number that shows the total sales.
Clustered Column Chart – Compares sales for different products over the years.
KPI Visual – Compares actual sales to a target number.
Gauge Chart – Shows how close the profit margin is to the target.
